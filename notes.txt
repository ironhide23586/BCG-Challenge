HV and VH Polarisations: 

Cross-polarisation is useful when volume (multiple) scattering occurs. It can allow the separation of soil and vegetation and of forest and non-forest.

VV Polarisation:

On its own, VV polarisation is used extensively for studying capillary waves on the surface of water bodies.
